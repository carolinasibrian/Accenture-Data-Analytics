 #### Task for Data Analyst :
Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

In short, the client wanted to see **“An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.** 

## Task - 2
 - Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
 - So, the first step is to use this [data model](https://cdn.theforage.com/vinternships/companyassets/T6kdcdKSTfg2aotxT/MsAqi7SNLKw3C6LAr/1664297834541/Data%20model.pdf) to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
 - After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:
 >- Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
 >- Content ID
 >- Reaction Types
 >- Content type
 >- Category
 
### Data Cleaning:
#### Clean the data by:
 - removing rows that have values which are missing,
 - changing the data type of some values within a column, and
 - removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
 - - Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

**End result will be three cleaned data set :**
 - [Reaction Types](https://github.com/carolinasibrian/Accenture-Data-Analytics/blob/main/ReactionTypes.csv)
 - [Reactions](https://github.com/carolinasibrian/Accenture-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Reactions.csv)
 - [Content](https://github.com/carolinasibrian/Accenture-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Content%20(1).csv)

### Data Modelling:

**Create a final data set by merging 3 tables**

**End result will be one spreadsheet**
 - A cleaned dataset
 - Top 5 categories
 
 ### Cleaned Data set:
 So, the cleaned data set after data modeling & data cleaning : [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/carolinasibrian/Accenture-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Cleaned_Dataset.csv)
